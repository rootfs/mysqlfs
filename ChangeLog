2008-04-10  Florian Wiessner <f.wiessner@smart-weblications.de>
	* Updated pool.h

2008-04-10  Florian Wiessner <f.wiessner@smart-weblications.de>
	* Added fsck support in query.c
	* Added -ofsck=1 switch to mysqlfs, fsck is only done when 
	  -ofsck=1 is set on commandline.
	* Updated TODO File

2008-04-09  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Migrated from CVS to SVN

2007-03-29  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Update NEWS and configure.in to release 0.4.0-rc1

2007-03-29  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Reworked data storage. Instead of one huge record 
	  for each file in table "data" we now store the data 
	  in 4kB chunks (a.k.a. "sectors" or "blocks"). That 
	  speeds up especially updates to files a _lot_ :-)
	  As a side effect it allows for storing "sparse" files.
	  CAUTION: database schema has changed in this version!

2006-10-03  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Updated version to 0.3.1
	* Added schema.sql to the distribution tarball. Oops!

2006-09-23  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Updated version to 0.3
	* Updated auxiliary files (README, TODO, ...)

2006-09-23  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Create root directory on startup if it doesn't exist.
	* Changed timestamp fields in 'inodes' table to 'int
	  unsigned' to avoid conversion between MYSQL timestamp and 
	  Unix timestamp in a number of queries.
	* Updated schema.sql. Now with autocreating '/' it's enough 
	  to use 'mysqldump -d' i.e. dump just the schema without
	  data.

2006-09-17  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* pool.c: Rewritten from scratch. It doesn't have a limit
	  on open connections anymore and instead creates new ones
	  on request. Returned connections are not immediately 
	  closed, instead put into a LIFO-type stack and reused
	  later. Maximum number of connections idling on the stack 
	  can be set as well as the initial number of connections
	  opened on start.
	  This rewrite triggered search-and-replace changes
	  in mysqlfs.c (no more MYSQL_CONN type). Instead I return
	  the connection itself (MYSQL*) though typed as (void*) -  
	  probably not the best choice. The intent was to
	  prepare for support of other DBs. It works for now but 
	  I'll likely rewrite or improve this later ;-)

	* Enable reconnect when mysql connection gone away.

2006-09-13  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Splitted table fs into a separate table for directory 
	  tree and a table for inodes. This triggered radical 
	  changes to most parts of the source. However now it's 
	  possible to have hardlinks, delayed unlink and some other 
	  sweeties difficult or impossible to implement with 
	  the previous scheme.
	* open() stores inode number in fi->fh and read(), write()
	  release() and some other functions use that instead 
	  of translating path name to inode every time.
	* Updated schema.sql for the new DB layout. No transition
	  tools from the previous schema are provided because I don't
	  believe anyone has any valuable data in their FS ;-) If you
	  do, tar them up, upgrade and untar back again.
	* Started migrating the FS logic to mysqlfs.c. In the future
	  query.c will only have query primitives and we'll perhaps 
	  have query.c files for other DBs as well (Oracle,
	  PostgreSQL, ...)
	* Increased default connection pool to 25 conns.
	* Added some plans to TODO list.
	* Implemented link(), chown().
	* Fixed truncate().

2006-09-07  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Read default MySQL options from one of my.cnf files.
	  Subsequently don't require the connect options
	  on the command line.

2006-09-06  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Check for MySQL version both in configure.in and
	  when actually connecting the server.
	* Fixed a few minor omissions. Now it should run again
	  even on other machines than my one ;-)

2006-09-04  Michal Ludvig  <michal@logix.cz>

	* Fixed write() to actually do what a decent write() is
	  supposed to do.
	* Pulled 'data' column to a separate table.
	* Implemented truncate(), symlink(), readlink()
	* Implemented limited rename() only for regular files
	* Added better logging infrastructure, converted
	  all plain printf() calls to log_printf()
	* Removed autogenerated files from CVS.
	* Various cleanups and improvements on autoconfig front.
	* Minor cleanups here and there.

2006-07-23  Tsukasa Hamano <code@cuspy.org>

	* Released 0.2

2006-06-08  Tsukasa Hamano <code@cuspy.org>
