The four images in here (as can be guessed by the letterhead in "page.png") are from http://dryicons.com/free-icons/icons-list/ruby-extended/, a collection of free icons that kinda work for me.

Every project needs some sort of basic "this is what it is" writeup, so I'm doing that in this directory, using these icons.  This is intended to replace the existing index.html
