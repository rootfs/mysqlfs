* Implement more robust connection pool
	- avoid -EMFILE when there are no more free connections

* Implement some security 
	- currently we allow all operations regardless on the privileges.

* Implement path->inode cache and inode->stat cache
	- getattr will greatly benefit from this

* Implement file buffering
	- running query after every write() is insane

* Implement support for xattr and acl
	- FUSE has the methods at least for xattr
