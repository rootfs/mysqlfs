What is new in 0.4.0
--------------------

* Reworked data storage. Instead of one huge record for each
  file we now store the data in 4kB blocks. That greatly 
  improves performance, storage efficiency and overcomes
  problems when storing files larger than 1MB. As a side
  effect it allows storing "sparse" files.

  errors.
